 == 3.00 (28-06-2016) ==
    - Migrated old lcd-mp3 which was originally made for the A/B models to use a new hat for the Raspberry Pi A+, B+, 2, and 3
      and renamed project to rpi3-lcd-mp3
    - Changes:
       - Moved from Makefile to cmake
         - To build:
            cmake -H. -Bbuild
            cmake --build build --
       - Added three LED indicators for normal play, pause, and mute
       - Moved around virtually every pin so I2C and serial can still function (might add real time clock later)

 == 2.08 (13-09-2015) ==
    - Another huge update; added a rotary encoder for volume control.
    - Rotary encoder uses 3 pins, using RxD, TxD, and SDA.  Now the only pin left unused is SCL from I2C.
    - Now requires libasound to compile.
    - The rotary encoder and volume control was borrowed from the MPD player found here:
      http://theatticlight.net/posts/My-Embedded-Music-Player-and-Sound-Server

    Setting up for final project.
    Things to be done:
    - Remove all ncurses / terminal output
    - Change -dir and -songs to -d and -s and --dir= and --songs=
    - song file names that have a space kill this... find out why
    - On startup, (assuming the /etc/fstab has already mounted a USB drive (/dev/sda1) to /MUSIC)
    - check /MUSIC and load in all music.
    - if Quit button is pressed, display "QUIT - Shutdown" and "PAUSE - Cancel"
